					<p><b>As a pre-schooler the world is bursting with newness.</b></p>
					<p>Each day is filled with one new discovery after another. Where did that bird come from? Look, the moon is shaped funny tonight! Who thought to color the butterfly like that?</p>
					<p>At <span class="connect" style="font-weight: bold;">Parents &amp; toddlers</span> we help focus these questions and consistently teach them one of three basic truths....
						<ol>
							<li>God made me</li>
							<li>God loves me</li>
							<li>Jesus wants to be my friend forever</li>
							<li>I need to make the wise choice.</li>
							<li>I can trust God no matter what.</li>
							<li>I should treat others the way I want to be treated.</li>
						</ol>
					<span class="connect" style="font-weight: bold;">Parents &amp; toddlers</span> helps kids get their first impression of their heavenly Father and the wonder of His love for each one of them.</p>
					<p><b>In this fun age of wonder and awe, we intentionally seek to direct their focus to the God of wonders. We have playtime, snacks, and we pray, teach, and play with our kids, showing them how to interact with each other in a safe and fun environment.</b></p>
					<p>All activities are age-appropriate with plenty of flexibility for the normal needs of toddlers. We believe in an active, hands-on approach with our kids, so be on the lookout for those fun projects!</p>

					<p>We love kids. We love them so much that we have a special service designed just for them. Our desire is to help parents raise kids who love Jesus. When you come to our Sunday morning meeting, just ask one of our staff member for information on where to take them.</p>

					<p>Think about all the different things they are trying for the first time and what they’re learning every day, even how to make (and keep) friends.</p>
					<p>At <span class="connect" style="font-weight: bold;">Kids Club</span>, we want to make sure these three things stick....

					<p><b>We want kids to see how God’s word fits into their lives, to learn how talk to Him, and to build friendships that will last.  If your kid is in 4-11 years old age, then this environment is designed just for them.</b></p>
					<p>Each kid is greeted by their small group leader. Kids participate in an activity meant to introduce the one Virtue, or bottom line, we want kids to walk away with and remember that evening.</p>
					<p>They hear a Bible story where we use computer slides to make the Bible come to life. We also carve out time each week for kids to sing as loud as they want and tell God how much they love Him.</p>
					<p>In small groups their leaders help them understand how the day’s bottom line can fit into their everyday life. Small group leaders are serious about having fun with kids and passionate about teaching the TRUTH. We want kids to see how God’s word fits into their lives, to learn how to talk to Him, and to build friendships that will last.</p>

					<p><b>Middle age is exciting and awkward.</b></p>
					<p>It’s a time of transition when you’re not a kid anymore, but you’re not an adult yet either. You’re trying to figure out who you are, while all of your friends are doing the same.</p>
					<p>If you are in middle age, <span class="connect" style="font-weight: bold;">Youth Group</span> is an environment designed just for you.</p>
					<p><b>For students, the pressure comes from all sides.....</b></p>
					<p>....it tells them to compromise. It takes their lives and tries to convince them that they are just preparing for what is to come, and the secondary school years are seen as practice for real life. The problem is that this isn’t practice, this isn’t rehearsal, this is it.</p>
					<p>At <span class="connect" style="font-weight: bold;">Youth Group</span> we’re living life now, and we’re doing life together.</p>
					<p>We connect students with God, with other students, and with leaders that are dedicated to seeing them grow closer to Jesus.</p>
					<p>We engage the youth and culture in order to help change the focus from ourselves, to looking up at God and how great He is. Changing our perspective from the confusion and troubles of this world to the beauty and majesty of our Creator.</p>
					<p><span class="connect" style="font-weight: bold;">Youth Group</span> is held every two weeks on Friday nights starting at 7pm ending around 9pm. Keep watching for dates.</p>
