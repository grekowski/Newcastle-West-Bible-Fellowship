Uploading for bulletin files is working now again, can you upload current file to the website?
Like on Facebook unfortunetly there is no easy way to edit or change your message. You have to remove it and type again and it will appear on top of the list.
Just simply start typing in the white box and when you finish hit Enter key and it will be posted to the list here. There is x mark on the right hand side to remove entry if you made a mistake. Hope you will find it helpfull and we will use it to put important messages and to comunicate together.
